# 🐱🐶 Cat and Dog Image Classification using CNN

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on classifying images of cats and dogs using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**. The model was developed as part of the **Bangkit Academy Machine Learning Path**, utilizing **TensorFlow and Keras** for deep learning implementation.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow & Keras
- Google Colaboratory
- NumPy, Matplotlib, and Pandas for data processing and visualization

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset consists of labeled images of cats and dogs. Preprocessing steps included:
- Data cleaning and augmentation
- Splitting into training and validation sets
- Resizing and normalization

## 🔬 Model Architecture
The CNN model is built using the following layers:
- **Convolutional Layers** with ReLU activation
- **Pooling Layers** to reduce dimensionality
- **Flatten Layer** to convert feature maps into a vector
- **Fully Connected (Dense) Layer** with Softmax activation for classification

## 📊 Training Results
- **Training accuracy**: 99.69%
- **Validation accuracy**: 83.31%
- **Loss analysis**: Signs of overfitting were observed, indicating further optimization potential.

## 📜 How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
